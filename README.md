# SOS: Mentor Connect

## Project Description
SOS: Mentor Connect is a dual-interface dashboard designed to bridge the gap between struggling hackers and available mentors during high-pressure events. Students can submit help tickets with live code links, while mentors can filter, track, and preview issues in real-time without leaving their dashboard. The website is adapted for both online and offline versions of hackathon.
